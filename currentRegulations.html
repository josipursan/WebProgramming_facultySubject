                <p>
                    Season 2014 saw the introduction of a hybrid engine system for the first time in F1's history. 
                    Engine regulations set in 2014 introduced 1.6L V6 engines with multiple energy recovery systems, and fuel flow restrictions. The V6 engines were also turbocharged, 
                    which was the first reappearance of turbocharged engines since the ban set at the end of eighties. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Priorly used KERS was renamed to MGU-K (Motor Generator Unit - Kinetic). This energy recovery system is capable of of providing a 160hp boost, or around 2MJ per lap. 
                    In addition to MGU-K, MGU-H (Motor Generator Unit - Heat) was also introduced. Energy recovery of MGU-H unit is not regulated. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the years have progressed, these hybrid engines were developed further and further, to a point where they efficiency of over 50%, which us unheard of in automotive industry.
                    Mercedes has set the bar from the get-go, and have been, more or less, uncontested when it comes to engine durability, elasticity, power, torque, top speed and acceleration. 
                    Mercedes' closest rival in engine performance has been Ferrari. Honda has had an abysmal first couple of seasons, but have stabilised in the last 2-3 seasons, and are showing great potential.
                    Renault has had a rather weak start in the new engine regulation era. Although they have rectified much of their issues, they aren't comparable to Ferrari or Mercedes.     
                </p>

                <p>
                    This new engine regulation era is marked by F1's efforts to sustain global efforts for more environmentally friendly propulsion systems. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    2019 season saw the increase in fuel allowance from 105kg to 110kg of fuel per race.

                <h1>Aerodynamics</h1>
                <p>
                    In 2017, number of fundamental changes were introduced to facilitate the design of better looking, and faster cars.
                    Front wing span was increased from 1650mm to 1800mm. Height of the rear wing was reduced to a maximum of 800mm, whereas its maximum was 950mm in the past. 
                    Rear difusser's influence was increased thanks to a height increase from 125mm to 175mm, and a width increase from 1000mm to 1050mm.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 2017 season saw another season of highly complex front wing structures, which continued into the next season. To counter negative effects created by these
                    highly complex wings, 2019 regulations saw another revamp of the front wing structure. Wider, higher, and much simplified front wings were introduced to support closer racing between drivers.
                    Wing's width was increased by 200mm, its height by 20mm, and it was moved forward by 25mm. Complex multiplane cascading endplates were banned. Also, front wing's main section was substantially 
                    cleaned up, allowing only multiple cascading planes, as opposed to highly complex structures developed throughout 2017 and 2018. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    New bargeboards were introduced to make them less powerful and less aerodynamically disruptive. Their height was reduced by 150mm, and they were moved forward by 100mm.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rear wings were heightened, widened and simplified. Height was increased by 20mm, width was increased by 100mm, DRS slot was enlarged by 20mm. 
                </p>

                <p>

                <p>
                    2017 season was also somewhat revolutionary for bodywork and chassis design. Overall car width was increased from 1800mm to 2000mm, which was a huge jump compared to the 2016 cars,
                    and has led to the creation of cars which were substantially larger than its predecessors. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tyres were increased by 25%, with rear tyre widths going up from 325mm to 405mm, and front tyre widths going up from 245mm to 305mm. Tyre diameter was also slightly increased,
                    but the wheel rim size remained unchanged at 13 inches. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maximum weight was increased from 702kg to 722kg plus tyres, and sidepod width was increased from 1400mm to 1600mm. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    2018 season was didn't see any major regulation changes, except the introduction of a wider tyre range.
                    The prominent change for 2018 season was the introduction of halo, a cockpit safety device mounted above, and in front of the driver's head. 
                    2018 season also saw the ban of shark fin and T-wings. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2019, brake ducts were largely simplified to reduce the aerodynamic exploitation of brake ducts, and car weight limits were rectified so that driver weight is
                    considered separately from the car. Minimum weight of car was up from 733kg to 740kg, and at least 80kg of that must be spent on the driver, his seat, and driving equipment. 
                    Lighter drivers can simply use ballast if the 80kg requirement is not met, but the ballast must be used inside the cockpit, not somewhere else on the car to improve its balance.
                    2019 season marks the introduction of safer, stronger helmets.
