        <h1>Engine</h1>
        <p>Engine regulations have changed greatly throughout the F1 history. First regulation set in the 50's declared a maximum engine size of 1500cc if used with suprecharger or turbcharger, and a maximum size of 4500cc for naturally aspirated engines.
          The end of fifties saw the ban of race fuels, and mandatory usage of commercial petrol. 
          Sixties saw also some changes to engines, but these were minor and only concerned with engine displacement. 
          Seventies were relatively uneventful when it comes to engine changes and regulations. Most prominent change was the introduction of a central fuel line.
        </p>

        <p>
          Turbo engines were used mostly in the eighties, as Renault proved turbo engines are the way to go with regards to power. To counter overdevelopment and possible dangers of turbo engines,
          boost pressures were limited at 4 bars. 
          The end of eighties saw a complete ban of turbo engines, and the introduction of natually aspirated 3500cc engines with 8-12 valves. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Engines were reduced in the nineties from 3500cc to 3000cc.
        </p>

        <p>
          From 2000 to 2005 V10 engines were used with their displacement being no more than 3000cc.
          This was changed in the 2006 when the V8 engines were introduced with engine capacity limited at 2400cc. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Beginning of 2010's saw the introduction of KERS - Kinetic Energy Recovery System. This system was used to regenerate part of energy generated during braking, and use that energy as
          power boost during lap. KERS has paved the way for full hybrid technology introduced in 2014.

        <h1>Aerodynamics</h1>
        <p>
          Aerodynamic devices in the early years of F1 were practically nonexistent. Later decades have offered some better attempts at exploiting aerodynamics to improve car performance.
          End of the seventies saw such an exploit in the form of Brabham BT46B, known as the "fan car". The car had a fan installed at its back which was used to suck out the air form underneath the car, thus creating negative lift ("suction"), and increasing downforce.
          Still, the car wasn't first ever to use aerodynamics. Many before and after used front and back wings in all shapes and sizes to try and benefit from increased downforce, but all of these attempts seem laughable compared to 90's and 00's.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nineties are the era in which cars and their aerodynamic devices assumed shape still familiar today. Front wings were reduced by 10cm, from 150cm to 140cm. Rear wing height was also reduced
          by 10cm from 100cm to 90cm, and the later during the 90's by another 10cm. Flexible wings were banned in 1999.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The beginning of 2000's saw a number of aerodynamic revisions. Multi element rear wings were banned, two element wings were mandated. Rear diffuser size was also reduced to limit downforce.
          Further changes were made to front and rear wings to facilitate easier overtaking. 
          End of this decade was characterized by the ban of almost all aerodynamic devices other than front and rear wing. Rear wing width was reduced from 1000mm to 750mm, and height was increased from 800mm to 950mm. 
          Front wing ground clearance was reduced from 150mm to 50mm, and its width was increased from 1400mm to 1800mm. Rear diffuser was increased in length and height. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The period from 2010 to 2016 saw some further revisions to rules defined at the end of 2000's. Double diffusers were banned, as well as F-duct system pioneered by McLaren. Adjustable front wings were also banned.
          DRS (Drag Reduction System) as such was introduced. Front wing and nose regulations were revised multiple times. Currently active major aerodynamics revision came in 2017.

        <h1>Chassis and safety</h1>
        <p>
          Early years of F1 were largely unregulated when it comes to chassis and driver safety. Cars were designed in all shapes and sizes, with very little, if any at all, driver safety
          features. The sixties mark the first coordinated and designed attempt at providing certain chassis regulations and omnipresent driver safety features. 
          This period saw the introduction of a minimum car weight of 450kg, and some years later a minimum car weight of 500kg, mandatory roll bars, double braking system, standardised seatbelt anchorage, fire protection for fuel tanks,
          mandatory protective helmet and overalls, and FIA safety inspections.
        </p>

        <p>  
          The end of sixties was marked by another set of chassis and safety rules. Having a reverse gear was introduced as mandatory, rollbar structure was revised to provide better head protection,
          two-part extinguisher system was introduced, as well as cockipts designed for quick and easy driver evacuation. 
          Fire-resistant clothing and shatterproof visors were also introduced.
        </p>
          
        <p>
          The seventies mark yet another era in which there was even more safety and chassis regulation revisions. Minimum car weights were increased three times. First to 530kg, then to 550kg, and lastly to 575kg.
          A lot of the features we still have today, such as marshalls, race supervisors, signalers, red rear car lights, crash safety structures, etc., were introduced during the seventies. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Eighties continued the trend of quickly rising number of rules and bans when it comes to chassis regulation and driver safety. 
          This decade saw the introduction of FIA super licence, which allowed better control of who can enter F1 racing. 
          Four wheel drive was also banned, along with cars with more than four wheels. Front crash tests were introduced to improve driver survivability in heavy crashes. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Nineties were a heaven for regulations and banning features. The most prominent ban was the ban of electronic driver aids such as active suspension, traction control, and many more.
          A number of chassis revisions were made in order to slow the cars down. Cockpit protection around driver's head was increased, car width was reduced, exhaustive testing of survival
          cell, now including rear impact tests.
          The year 1992 also saw the introduction of the safety car - a vehicle which regulates the pace of the field if an accident has occured. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The 2000's were marked by yet another weight increase. Minimum weight was set at 605kg during qualifying, and no less than 600kg at all other times. Pit lane speed limit was set at 100km/h at all times.
          Bi directional telemetry was banned, and HANS (Head And Neck Support) was introduced to improve head and neck safety. Tuned mass dampers were quickly banned after their potential was demonstrated
          by Renault. Year 2009 saw the introduction of KERS - Kinetic Energy Recovery System. This system was used to recover some energy generated during braking, and use it later during the lap as a power boost.
        </p>  

        <p>
          Start of the 2010's saw a one year hiatus of KERS so that all of the manufacturers could polish out and issues. KERS was reintroduced in 2011. 
          The period between 2010 and 2014 saw the introduction of some interesting solutions such as the off-blown diffuser, helium air guns. This decade is also marked by a number of 
          chassis and body redesigns.
